# sf-crimes
Data descriptions, visualisations and model fitting on San Francisco crime data from 2003 to 2014. 

See the jupyter notebook (ipynb file) for the full report.  

This work is a group project for a Python course at Ecole Polytechnique's MSc. Data Science for Business. As such, more attention was given Python programming and building cool visualisation, than to rigorous statistical analysis.  
The dataset was found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data . We were interested in the data bt our goal was not to solve the kaggle challenge.
